# Monte-Carlo-Stock-Simulation
This project demonstrates how to simulate future stock prices using a Monte Carlo method based on Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) â€” a popular model in quantitative finance. The simulation helps visualize the range of potential future outcomes for a stock, taking into account daily randomness, expected return, and volatility.
